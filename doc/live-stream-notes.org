** DONE Fix failing builds

   - [X] git-annex

   The new version has a broken test suite, so we can't update yet. Need to
   report that problem to Joey.

   - [X] cachix

   The test suite failes. Filed a bug report.

   - [X] idris

   The test suite fails (big time). Just disabled the test suite.

** DONE Update list of broken builds
** DONE VulkanMemoryAllocator: Add extra library necessary for compilation

   https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/89160

** DONE Fix with-packages-wrapper MacOS linker hack for GHC 8.8

   https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/89156

** DONE add maintainer scripts for haskell package generation

   https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/86699

** DONE rebase haskell-updates on master
** DONE Re-generate the hackage-packages.nix file.
** DONE Check whether the git-annex overrides for src are still necessary

   Yes, the overrides are still necessary, because the Hackage release tarball
   does not contain the Makefile that we use to call "make install" as part of
   our build.

** TODO Write a bug report to Joey because of failing git-annex test suites
** TODO We need a way to provide the latest hackage2nix via Nix

   - Add a shell.nix file into the cabal2nix repository.

   - Turn the update-nixpkgs.sh et al scripts into nix-shell scripts that
     transparently set up their own environment in which they want to run.

   - Use fetchgit and update the commit id and hash every time the git
     repository changens. It's not pretty, but it would work. The update
     process that updates haskell-packages.nix already could do this as well.

   - Turn cabal2nix repo into a flake?
