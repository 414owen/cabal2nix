Hackage package derivations are found in the
```hackage-packages.nix`` <https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/haskell-modules/hackage-packages.nix>`__
file within ``nixpkgs`` and are used as the initial package set for
``haskellPackages``. The ``hackage-packages.nix`` file is not meant to
be edited by hand, but rather autogenerated by
```hackage2nix`` <https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/tree/master/hackage2nix>`__,
which by default uses the
```configuration-hackage2nix.yaml`` <https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/haskell-modules/configuration-hackage2nix.yaml>`__
file to generate all the derivations.

To modify the contents ``configuration-hackage2nix.yaml``, follow the
instructions on
```hackage2nix`` <https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/tree/master/hackage2nix>`__.
