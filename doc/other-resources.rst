-  The Youtube video `Nix Loves
   Haskell <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsBhi_r-OeE>`__ provides an
   introduction into Haskell NG aimed at beginners. The slides are
   available at http://cryp.to/nixos-meetup-3-slides.pdf and also – in a
   form ready for cut & paste – at
   https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/blob/master/doc/nixos-meetup-3-slides.md.

-  Another Youtube video is `Escaping Cabal Hell with
   Nix <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQd3s57n_2Y>`__, which discusses
   the subject of Haskell development with Nix but also provides a basic
   introduction to Nix as well, i.e. it’s suitable for viewers with
   almost no prior Nix experience.

-  Oliver Charles wrote a very nice `Tutorial how to develop Haskell
   packages with Nix <http://wiki.ocharles.org.uk/Nix>`__.

-  The *Journey into the Haskell NG infrastructure* series of postings
   describe the new Haskell infrastructure in great detail:

   -  `Part 1 <https://nixos.org/nix-dev/2015-January/015591.html>`__
      explains the differences between the old and the new code and
      gives instructions how to migrate to the new setup.

   -  `Part 2 <https://nixos.org/nix-dev/2015-January/015608.html>`__
      looks in-depth at how to tweak and configure your setup by means
      of overrides.

   -  `Part 3 <https://nixos.org/nix-dev/2015-April/016912.html>`__
      describes the infrastructure that keeps the Haskell package set in
      Nixpkgs up-to-date.
